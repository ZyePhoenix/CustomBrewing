# CustomBrewing

Define custom brewing recipes and provide unique give commands.

Currently defined potions brewing recipes:
- bottle of milk \(only used as brewing ingredient\) \- bucket of milk \+ empty bottles
- splash milk potion \- gunpowder \+ bottles of milk
- debuff removing only potion \- netherite ingot + splash milk potions

com.gmail.ryderzye.CustomPotionBrewing.Commands:
- /milkpotion \<amount\>
- /debuffpotion \<amount\>

TODO:
- balance debuff remover brewing cost
- extract potion recipe creation to be independent of internal methods
- add config option to enable and disable defined potions

Unique commands based on my fork of [MineGoldNetwork/Milkpotion](https://github.com/MineGoldNetwork/MilkPotion)
