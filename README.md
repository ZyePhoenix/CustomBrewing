# CustomBrewing

Define custom brewing recipes and provide unique give commands.

Currently defined potions brewing recipes:
- bottle of milk \(only used as brewing ingredient\) \- bucket of milk \+ empty bottles
- splash milk potion \- gunpowder \+ bottles of milk

Commands:
- /milkpotion \<amount\>

TODO:
- extract potion recipe creation to be independent of internal methods
- add config option to enable and disable defined potions (this branch does not have debuff remover)

Unique commands based on my fork of [MineGoldNetwork/Milkpotion](https://github.com/MineGoldNetwork/MilkPotion)
